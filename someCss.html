	<h1>Foster City</h1>
	<p class="p1">Foster City was my hometwon was in a little city in the suburbs just outside of San Francisco. I basically lived there my entire life until my senior year of high school when I moved to another city only 20 minutes away.</p>

	<p class="p2">Foster City had everything you needed to live. It had a Target, an Asian market, and a Costco all within a 5 minute drive plus the city surrounded a lagoon where a lot of the residents drove their boats out during summer nights.</p>
