							<h2>Stop and Smell the Roses</h2>

						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>What it really means to "stop and smell the roses" is to go outside and explore, touch, smell, experience the natural world around you. It means to take time out of your busy day to completely immerse yourself in the natural world we were created to live in and to learn to truly appreciate just how blessed we are to be living in it. Stop and Experience the World is a national campaign aiming to inspire Americans to get invovled with their surroundings. To take a walk in the woods once in awhile. To breathe in the fresh air and to soak in the sun's warmth. To truly live as an inhabitant of Earth and learn to love the nature that creates this planet we all share.</p>
							<p>Through various benefits, the Stop and Experience the World campaign is making long strides towards challenging fellow citizens to experience something new out in the wilderness and to not be afraid of the unknown. Stop and Experience the World hopes to make adventurers and explorers out of the average American who spends most of their time indoors and in a cubicle. Are you up to the challenge?</p>

								<h3>Stop and Smell Your Surroundings</h3>
								<p>It is so easy to rush through paths and trails to get to a certain endpoint without ever stopping to notice the beauty that surrounds you. Wherever you find yourself, always take a moment to look around, breathe, listen and just be in the moment with all the creatures that share that space with you.</p>
